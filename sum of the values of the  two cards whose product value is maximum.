/*A game company has designed an online lottery game, Bingo. 
In this game, N number cards are displayed. Each card has a
value on it. The value can be negative or positive. 
The player must choose two cards. To win the game, the 
product of the values of the two cards must be the maximum 
value possible for any pair of cards in the display. The winning amount will
be the sum of the two cards chosen by the player,

Wote an algorithm to find the winning amount as the sum of the 
values of the two cards whose produa value is
maximum.*/



/*Input
The first line of the input consists of an Integer numCards 
representing the number of cards (N). . The second line consists 
of N space-separated integers - val, val. val representing the values on the cards.

Output
Print an integer representing the sum of the values of the 
two cards whose product value is maximum.

/*Example

Input
9 -3 8 -6 -7 8 10
Output
19
